# Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks

  This session comprises of a fairly basic introduction to Artificial Intelligence
  and its branches. This will be a hands on session to span multiple and we will be
  using python programming language. Thus, ensure that you have python interpreter
  and all libraries below are installed install.
